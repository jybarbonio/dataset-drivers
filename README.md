# Analyzing Demographic Bias in Shared Micro-Mobility Services #
These programs are designed to process social data in the form of social media-aggregated images and
AI-derived analysis of said images specified within accompanying .json files.

# Summarization of Significance and Research Objectives #
The rise of affordable micromobility solutions such as shared e-scooters in urban transport environments
has necessitated the need for research into their potential social impact, and whether biases exist in
regards to equitable access or characteristic inclusivity that may affect efficiency and sustainability of
these services. The goal of this project is, in the short-term, to determine the existence of demographic
bias in the shared e-scooter ecosystem, and in the long-term develop policy proposals to address and
eliminate any discovered biases. Our team's goal is to promote equitable urban mobility within a sustainable
framework for efficient smart cities, expanding transportation services for all members of the community.

# Use Instructions #
Provide open_directory with a folder directory of images for imageprocessor, or .json files for jsonprocessor.
