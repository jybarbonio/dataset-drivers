'''
Program Purpose:
    to truncate scooter rider images into simple hash values that can be compared
    to filter out duplicates. A file path can be specified where images within will
    be iterated through

To-Do:
    GUI and saving tuples of filepaths w/ associated generated hash values
    hash lookup for faster deletion/marking of duplicates
    integrating quicksort to be called for every new hash added or alternative sort such as a heap
    parallel computing
    
Pipeline is currently:
    open_directory, open_image -> quicksort -> partition -> return runtime and list
